### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive console-based Temperature Converter application using C++. The application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units.

### Key Activities
- **Menu Display and User Input**: The program starts by displaying a menu for temperature unit selection (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) and prompts the user to choose the units for conversion.
- **Input Validation**: It checks the user input for validity (range check and exit option).
- **Temperature Conversion**: Depending on the user's selections (ch1 and ch2), the program converts the temperature entered by the user (temp) from one unit to another (Celsius to Fahrenheit, Celsius to Kelvin, etc.).
- **Output**: After conversion, the program displays the converted temperature along with the corresponding unit (°C, °F, or K) using appropriate console text colors for emphasis and clarity.

### Technologies Used
- **Development Environment, Compiler & IDE**:Such as Visual Studio, or any C++ compatible IDE for writing and debugging the code with GCC Compiler to run and compile the files.
- **Libraries**:
-   <iostream>: Standard C++ library for input and output operations.
-   <windows.h>: Windows API library for handling console text color and other console-specific functions.
- **Console Commands**: system("cls"): To clear the console screen.

### Key Insights
- **Interactive Console Application**:he program demonstrates how to create an interactive console application in C++, allowing users to input choices and receive converted temperature results dynamically.
- **Windows Console Manipulation**: It showcases the use of Windows API (<windows.h>) functions like SetConsoleTextAttribute() to enhance user experience by displaying messages in different colors for clarity and emphasis.
- **Modular Design**: The program is structured using functions (temperatureConverter() and main()), promoting code organization and reusability. This modular approach separates user interface logic from temperature conversion calculations.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic input validation to handle invalid user inputs gracefully, ensuring the program responds appropriately to incorrect choices without crashing or displaying confusing outputs.
